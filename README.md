# CMU Pixelator
CMU link - https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/<br>
### Usage
1. ```pip install pillow && pip install pynput```
2. ```python pixelator.py```
### Recommendations
CMU lags quite a bit when a lot of text is in the sandbox. I recommend using an image of max 150x150 to stay under the lag threshold.
